        <h2>How Public‑Service Ham Radio Supports Races, Parades & Events</h2>
        <p>For event organizers, sponsors, and municipalities</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-container">
        <h2>Why Use Ham Radio?</h2>
        <p>Amateur radio operators provide a proven, reliable communications backbone for public events of any size. Here's what makes ham radio an ideal choice for event communications:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent, reliable voice & data mesh</strong> – Works even when cellular or Wi‑Fi is overloaded or down.</li>
            <li><strong>Off‑grid power</strong> – Battery, solar, or generator‑backed radios keep communications alive for hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid deployment</strong> – A portable repeater or mobile command station can be set up in less than 30 minutes and moved as the route changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct link to emergency services</strong> – Trained operators speak the same frequencies as police, fire, EMS, and local officials.</li>
            <li><strong>Real‑time logging</strong> – Every call, incident, and resource movement is recorded for post‑event analysis.</li>
        </ul>
