				<h2>What Are MARS/CAP Mods?</h2>
				<p><strong>MARS</strong> = Military Auxiliary Radio System<br>
				   <strong>CAP</strong> = Civil Air Patrol</p>
				<p>Both organizations operate on frequencies just outside the regular amateur bands (VHF and UHF). A “MARS/CAP mod” is a hardware or software change that expands a radio’s <strong>transmit</strong> range so it can legally operate on those assigned government/emergency frequencies when you are a properly licensed and affiliated member.</p>
		
				<div class="callout info">
					<p><strong>U.S. amateur band limits:</strong><br>
					   2 m: 144–148 MHz | 70 cm: 420–450 MHz</p>
				</div>
		
				<p class="note"><strong>Not all radios can be modified</strong> – some are locked by firmware or hardware design.</p>

				<h2>Why Would I Need This Modification?</h2>
				<p><strong>Interoperability during emergencies.</strong></p>
				<p>Example from real life:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Joint exercise with county Fire/EMS, CERT, and ARES</li>
					<li>Used authorized itinerant frequencies to coordinate search teams and officials</li>
					<li>A real medical emergency occurred; the Fire Battalion Chief was in a dead zone on county radios</li>
					<li>With a MARS/CAP-modified radio, I could hear him and relay critical traffic to medics</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Without the mod, that relay would have been impossible.</p>

				<h2>Legality & Responsible Use</h2>
		
				<div class="callout warning">
					<p><strong>I am not a lawyer – this is not legal advice.</strong></p>
				</div>
		
				<ul>
					<li>New hams almost never need this modification.</li>
					<li>It becomes relevant only if you formally join an EMCOMM, AUXCOMM, MARS, or CAP unit that requires out-of-band transmit capability under their official authorization.</li>
					<li>Your local EMCOMM/AUXCOMM leadership is the best source of guidance.</li>
					<li>Using a MARS/CAP mod to transmit on GMRS, FRS, MURS, or other services you’re not licensed for is <strong>not legal</strong> and not a valid reason to perform the mod.</li>
				</ul>
